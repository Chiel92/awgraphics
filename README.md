# awgraphics

This is a C# OpenGL graphics library build on top of [OpenTK](https://github.com/opentk/opentk).

Our goal is wrapping the static OpenGL interface into a nicer object-oriented one and providing various layers of abstractions to make setting up programs and games consuming OpenGL much easier.

At the same time, performance is very important to us, and we strive to reduce any overhead introduced by these abstractions to a minimum.

## Is this library being used anywhere?

Sure is:

- [Roche Fusion](https://rochefusion.com)
- [Bearded.TD](https://github.com/beardgame/td)
- [Photones](https://github.com/photones/photones)
- _your project here (get in touch!)_

## Current state of the library

While the library is very much functional, it's nowhere near as well maintained and feature complete as we'd like.

Feel free to do with this as you please! Pull requests are also very welcome.
